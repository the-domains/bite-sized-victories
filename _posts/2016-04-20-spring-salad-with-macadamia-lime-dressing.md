## Directions:

* Preheat the oven to 200°C and line two roasting pans (or trays) with parchment paper.

## To Make The Dressing

* Put the macadamia nuts in a food processor and grind them until they become a paste.
* Add the lime juice, lime zest, honey, ground ginger, cider vinegar, salt and blend until fully combined.
* Now add water, a Tbl at a time, blending after each addition, until the dressing is the perfect consistency to dress a salad - not too gloopy, not fully a liquid. 

## To Cook The Vegetables

* Peel and cut the kumara, carrots or beets into approximately 1cm sticks. Trim the ends off the asparagus. Roughly chop spring onions. Please don't be too precise with the cutting, they will cope with not being even - roasted veggies find their way. 
* Place the hardier vegetables (kumara, carrots, beets, fennel) together in one pan, the more delicate (asparagus, spring onion) in the second pan.
* Drizzle the oil over the vegetables and sprinkle the salt. Give them a shake or mix with your hands. 
* Put the first tray in the oven and set a timer for 10 minutes.
* When the 10 minutes are up, add the second tray of vegetables to the oven. Cook both for 15 minutes.
* Remove all vegetables when they look slightly crispy and browned.
* Dump the vegetables out onto some paper towel to blot up some of the oil.
* Transfer the cooked vegetables to a bowl or platter and pour over the dressing.
