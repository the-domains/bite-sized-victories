## Ingredients:

For The Chocolate Chips

* 20g Golden Syrup
* 140g Cream
* 125g Dark chocolate
* Pinch of salt

For The Cookie Dough

* 440g Plain Flour
* 1/2 tsp Bicarbonate of Soda
* 1 tsp Baking Powder
* 5g Salt
* 1/2 tsp Coffee Powder
* 230g Unsalted Butter- cold and cubed
* 520g Caster Sugar
* 2 Large Eggs
* 15g Vanilla Bean Paste

## Directions:

To Make The Chocolate Truffle Chips

* In a small saucepan, bring the cream and golden syrup to a slow simmer.
* Place the chocolate in a medium, heat-proof bowl and pour the warm cream over it.
* Allow the chocolate to sit for a few minutes, stirring if it's not melting evenly.
* Pour out onto a baking sheet that you've lined with baking paper.
* Let this hang out for about an hour, until it's room temperature.
* Place into the freezer for 3-5 hours, or until it's solid.
* Remove from freezer and allow to sit for 5 minutes.
* Turn out onto a cutting board and cut into chips.
* Preheat oven to 190C/375F and line baking trays with baking paper.

To Make The Dough

* Sift together the flour, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
* Cream the cold butter with the sugar until light and fluffy. Don't worry if it's taking ages, you want it very fluffy!
* Add the eggs one at a time, wiping down the sides between each.
* Add in the vanilla paste and mix again.
* Add the sifted ingredients plus coffee powder to the butter/sugar mixture and mix for a couple of minutes or until a dough is formed.
* Add the frozen chocolate chips and mix gently. You don't want to overwork it here because the chocolate chips do start melting. You can place mixture in the fridge for a little while if it is getting too warm and difficult to work with.
* Place spoonfuls (about 40 grams) onto the baking trays, leaving plenty of room between cookies. Don't crowd, I manage about 6 on each tray.
* Bake for 8-10 minutes or until lightly golden.
* Allow to cool on tray a little before removing to a wire rack.
