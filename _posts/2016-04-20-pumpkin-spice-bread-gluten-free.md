# Pumpkin Spice Bread (Gluten Free)

## Ingredients:

* 1 cup (200g) white sugar
* 1.5 cups (180g) self-raising, gluten free flour mix (or regular self-raising flour)
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* ¾ tsp ground ginger
* ½ tsp nutmeg
* ¼ tsp allspice
* ¼ tsp salt
* ½ cup (115g) butter - melted and slightly cooled
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup (240ml) pumpkin puree
* 1 tsp vanilla essence
* 1 tsp molasses
* (¼ cup water if you're using regular flour)

## Directions:

* Preheat oven to 180°C/355°F
* Make sure your butter is melted and slightly cooled
* Grease one regular loaf tin or two mini tins.
* In a medium bowl, weigh or measure out the sugar, flour, baking soda, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, allspice, and salt. Use a whisk and mix until thoroughly combined.
* In a separate, large bowl combine the butter, eggs, pumpkin puree, vanilla, and molasses. (Add ¼ cup of water if you are using gluten flour.) 
* Tip the contents of the first bowl into the second bowl. Use a wooden spoon and gently mix until just combined. You don't want to beat the mixture, just keep folding it until no more dry patches are visible.
* Transfer to the greased loaf tin(s) and use a small spatula to even out the tops. Bake for about 35 mins for small tins and about 45 mins for large. You'll know it's done when a skewer plunged into the middle comes out completely clean.
* Allow to cool in tin(s) for 15 minutes. Remove by gently tipping upside down into your hand, then place on a wire rack to cool completely.
