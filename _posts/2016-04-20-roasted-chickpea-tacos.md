## Directions:

## Chickpeas

* Preheat oven to 200°C
* Measure out the first 4 ingredients.
* Drain chickpeas and blot dry with a little paper towel.
* Put chickpeas in bowl and add the cumin, oregano, paprika, salt and chilli along with the olive oil. Use a large spoon (or hands - I find that easier here) to mix until the chickpeas are evenly coated.
* Dump out on to a baking sheet and give the sheet a little shake so the chickpeas aren't all clumped together.
* Bake in oven for about 30 minutes, giving the sheet a gentle shake halfway through cooking so that the chickpeas roll around. You are looking for them to evenly brown up and go quite crispy. Carefully pick one up (and feel free to do that quick juggle between palms of hands until it cools enough) and test the crunch factor. They are the best when they crunch more than they fold in on themselves but if super-crunchy food is an issue for you because of pain, stop them whenever you feel comfortable. I'd suggest first checking them at 20 minutes if this is the case.
* The chickpeas can hang out on the counter up to a day. When ready to eat- place them back in a warm oven for up to 5 minutes until they are hot to the touch again.

## Sauté Greens

* Over medium heat, in a medium saucepan, put 1 Tbl olive oil and 1/4 cup of water or stock. Add 4 large handfulls of greens (depending on number of people, remember they can cook down quite a bit) and cover.
* Leave to cook for 5 minutes.
* Remove cover and leave to simmer until all of the water has evaporated.
* You can put these aside as needed. If they go cold, just place them back on the heat for a few minutes until heated through.

## Warm The Tortillas

* Put up to 6 tortillas on a plate and cover with a piece of damp paper towel.
* Microwave on high in 30 second bursts until hot.
